# Eidolon

### Made by: Tara Laraine S. Pablo, 9-Strontium

---

**Description:**

> Eidolon is a pixel game set inside of the Edge Lab of Pisay.<br /><br />You play as Elijah, a ghost who recently just died inside of the Edge Lab
and cannot leave the room. You cannot pass on to the afterlife until
you have figured out how you died. The only catch? You have no memory
of your death. <br/><br/> Will you be able to figure out your own
death or will you live the rest of eternity as a wandering inside of
the Edge Lab? <br>

### Aesthetics
<p>This portion will cover aesthetics for both the overall website and the individual webpages.</p>

**Overall Website**
- Very hard to describe overall actually. Basically I could describe the aesthetic as like an indie pixel game with a horror-ish scheme, but not too horror (gore, jumpscares, etc) 

**Homepage**
- Something like the FNAF1 homepage (see image for context)
<p>images:</p>
![Fnaf1]()

**About page**
- Format option: something out of an old camera menu?
- Similar aesthetics to the homepage
<p>images:</p>

**Chapters page**
- Similar aesthetics to the homepage
<p>images:</p>

**Notepad page**
- Similar aesthetics to the homepage
- Something with a background similar to the one in the homepage
- Somewhat eerie vibes?

**Chapter 1**
- Similar aesthetics to the gameplay of Omori, Deltarune, etc. (etc because I can't think of other examples)
- Less colorful the games mentioned, but still a different color scheme than the current Edge Lab
