          Eidolon is a pixel game set inside of the Edge Lab of Pisay.<br /><br />You
          play as Elijah, a ghost who recently just died inside of the Edge Lab
          and cannot leave the room. You cannot pass on to the afterlife until
          you have figured out how you died. The only catch? You have no memory
          of your death. <br /><br />Will you be able to figure out your own
          death or will you have to live the rest of eternity as a wandering inside of
          the Edge Lab?

            I already had this concept a while back, but I never started
            working on it until now.

            For gameplay/style of game I would say Omori. The story of the game
            kinda has no inspiritaion. The closest I can think of is Life is
            Strange: True Colors

            I started January 9, 2025 right after my former partner for CS
            official split up with me from a different project. Since their idea
            was almost the whole of the previous project, I had to create my own
            story and sprites. I made it easier for myself to make a game since
            we did agree to share the code for the JS. Right now, the game isn't
            finished, and hopefully by YMSAT I have already finished chapter 1.

            Everything was a challenge. Especially working alone on the project.

            I used glitch to code the game, pixilart for making the sprites, and
            tiled to create the maps
