**Description:**

> Eidolon is a pixel game set inside of the Edge Lab of Pisay.<br /><br />You play as Elijah, a ghost who recently just died inside of the Edge Lab
and cannot leave the room. You cannot pass on to the afterlife until
you have figured out how you died. The only catch? You have no memory
of your death. <br/><br/> Will you be able to figure out your own
death or will you live the rest of eternity as a wandering inside of
the Edge Lab? <br>
